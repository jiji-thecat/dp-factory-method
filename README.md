# Design Pattern - Factory Method Pattern

## Description

The Factory Method pattern enables a subclass to generate instances flexibly, thus enhancing reusability of the class. To understand this concept better, let's delve into a class diagram in the next section.

### Class Diagram

This pattern bears resemblance to the Template Method pattern. In the [Template Method pattern](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-template-method), the Taiyaki mold class serves as the superclass acting as the template, with subclasses utilizing this template. The Taiyaki mold class defines the flow to create a Taiyaki, while subclasses are able to override specific steps of this flow, such as `filling()` and `crustColor()`. However, they are restricted from altering the overall flow. The distinction between the Template Method and Factory Method lies in the latter's allowance for subclasses to control the flow by enabling them to generate instances.

#### Correspondence Table Between Taiyaki and Class Diagram

| Class           | Taiyaki Example             |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Creator         | Taiyaki Mold Class          |
| Product         | Taiyaki Class               |
| ConcreteCreator | Concrete Taiyaki Mold Class |
| ConcreteProduct | Concrete Taiyaki Class      |

## How to Use This App

This application bears similarity to the [Template Method pattern](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-template-method). The distinction lies in the addition of the `bowl` row for the Factory Method pattern, allowing animals to use their preferred bowl. In this app, the Cat class employs the Factory Method pattern to select its preferred bowl. The Cat class generates the instance within its class, while for Rabbit and Bear, instances are generated in the superclass.
